# Hi there 👋, my name is Edwin Murithi Gitonga
I'm a Kenyan. I'm a computer science degree holder from Kabrak University. Throughout my career I've been able to gain a bunch of skills and experience in software development and design and data science. I'm especially more obsessed by android applications development. I've strong experience in Java, Kotlin, MySQL database and REST Api's all for building the backend. I also have experience in XML and Jetpack Compose for building the UI. Using the clean architecture coding guidelines I've been able to work on various projects both personal and industrial and therefore I can qualify myself as a professional android developer. I'm always ready for any challenges and I really enjoy being a programmer.
